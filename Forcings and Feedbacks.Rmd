Energy balance at the top of the atmosphere

$$F_{TOA} =F_{Solar}-F{IR}$$

If the planet is in equilibrium, these two balance at the top of the atmosphere and the net top-of-the-atmosphere flux $F_{TOA}=0$

Now, $F_{TOA}$ is a function of the surface temperature and many other variables.

$$F_{TOA}=F_{TOA}\left(T_S,x_1,x_2 \dots x_N\right)$$
