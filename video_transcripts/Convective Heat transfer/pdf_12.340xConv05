In the last video, we saw that the radiative equilibrium
of a troposphere is unstable to convection.
We showed that by demonstrating that when the entropy decreases
with altitude, as it does in the radiative equilibrium solution,
the atmosphere is unstable to convection.
And that convection will quickly render the atmosphere
nearly neutral to convection, which
means that the entropy profile would be constant with height.
Now, this brings us to the subject of radiative convective
equilibrium.
This is what happens when both radiation and convection are
active and establish a new equilibrium.
This equilibrium is different qualitatively
from radiative equilibrium in that it
is a statistical equilibrium state.
Convection itself is chaotic.
That is convection is very time-dependent.
It varies a lot in a space, like boiling water.
But if we take an average over many convective plumes
or over much time, we can derive a state
which is statistically stable which
we call radiative convective equilibrium.
Now, the easiest way to calculate that is simply
to assume that what the convection does
is render the atmosphere neutral to itself, that is render
the atmosphere as having a constant entropy profile.
And so whenever we find in a radiative equilibrium state
that the entropy actually decreases with height,
we adjust the entropy profile back
to constant while conserving energy.
This is the simplest way of estimating
the radiative convective equilibrium state.
Now, here is a diagram that shows
what that adjustment actually does.
So what you see here is the original radiative equilibrium
profile, this profile here.
And the profile, once it's been adjusted-- that's this profile
here-- this represents constant entropy,
which means that the temperature lapse
rate is g over cp, about 1 degree per 100 meters.
Let's compare these two profiles.
Remember that the pure radiative equilibrium
had a very high surface temperature of 333 degrees
Kelvin, of course, much higher than observed anywhere
on the planet.
But the adjusted state is much cooler at the surface,
although still much warmer than observed with a surface
temperature of about 318 Kelvin.
Note that the profile of temperature
in the adjusted state, here, obeys
the constant entropy lapse rate of about a degree per 100
meters.
So you'll notice that this adjusted state
is much warmer through much of the troposphere
except very close to the surface where it's cooler.
You might also notice the profiles are slightly
different even in the stratosphere.
Now, why should that be so?
After all, the stratosphere, unlike the troposphere,
the radiative equilibrium state is actually
stable to convection.
So why do we see any difference?
This is a reminder that radiative transfer
is non-local, that is if one changes the temperature
or emissivity of any part of the atmosphere, that changes
the radiation emitted from that layer.
And that, in turn, will change the radiation
absorbed by other layers.
So whenever one makes an adjustment
to one part of the atmosphere, potentially,
any other part of the atmosphere can adjust.
And we see that in this adjusted profile.
Now, although the radiative convective equilibrium solution
is much closer to what we observe
in the atmosphere than the pure radiative equilibrium,
it still has some problems.
It's still too hot at the surface and too cold
at the tropopause.
Why is that?
Well, it turns out that the reason for this,
for the most part, is that in the real atmosphere,
convection involves a phase change of water.
And whenever water changes phase in convection
in the atmosphere, we call that kind
of convection moist convection.
Now, here is a photograph I once took from an airplane showing
a typical cloudscape in the tropical atmosphere.
It's really quite beautiful.
What one sees is this collection of cumulus clouds-- here's one,
for example-- ranging in size some very small fractus
clouds, like this guy, to trade cumulus clouds, like this one.
And in the distance, one sees a very large cumulonimbus cloud
going all the way up to the tropopause.
Several things to note about this.
First of all, what is a cloud?
A cloud is simply a very dense collection
of very tiny condensed water droplets
or ice crystals depending on the temperature.
They're so small that their terminal velocities are tiny
compared to air motions.
And we can consider the water to be in suspension.
Now, condensed water forms in the atmosphere,
generally speaking, when samples of air expand and cool,
their saturation vapor pressure drops down
to below the actual vapor pressure
of the sample, water vapor condenses and forms a cloud.
This happens most commonly when air
rises from high pressure near the surface towards lower
pressure higher in the atmosphere.
It expands and cools.
And we'll talk a little bit about how
that happens in a moment.
But for now, just think of these cumulus clouds
as representing places where air is on the whole ascending.
When water vapor condenses in the atmosphere,
it releases the latent heat of vaporization.
When it freezes, it also releases the latent heat
of fusion.
So air ascending in these clouds is not
cooling at the adiabatic lapse rate we defined before.
Therefore, our whole idea of convective adjustment
has to be altered to account for this heat released
when water vapor condenses.
Another thing to notice about this state
is that, very typically, the updrafts,
as denoted by the clouds, cover a relatively small
fractional area of the sky, that is there is somewhat more clear
air than there are clouds in a scene like this.
This scenario that you see in this photograph
is very much what we would expect
to see in an atmosphere that was in radiative moist convective
equilibrium where the two main heat transfer processes are
radiation and moist convection.
Moist convection extends from a few hundred meters
above the ocean surface, sometimes higher
above the land surface, in some cases
like this cloud in the background all the way up
to the tropopause.
Below the bases of the clouds, very frequently, the atmosphere
is undergoing dry convection, that
is without a phase change of water.
Let's talk a little bit about moist convection.
The important properties of moist convection,
so far as they affect the equilibrium state,
is, as I mentioned before, significant heating owing
to the phase change of water.
This phase change, by the way, can and does
operate in both directions.
Water condenses in the atmosphere.
Condensed water also evaporates, in many cases,
absorbing the latent heat of vaporization or fusion
and causing the air cool.
The other important aspect of moist convection
is that it redistributes from its source at the surface water
up through the atmosphere.
It is because of moist convection that our atmosphere
itself is moist.
Convection is the agent of lofting water.
But water vapor, as we've seen before,
is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
So the moist convective radiative equilibrium
is strongly interactive.
The instability of the radiative equilibrium
drives moist convection.
The moist convection lofts water from its source at the surface
and controls the water vapor content
of the atmosphere, which, in turn, determines
to a large degree the radiative transfer.
The other important aspect of moist convection
is that by lofting water, it indirectly
contributes to stratiform cloudiness,
that is layered clouds, which have
a large effect both on shortwave and longwave radiative
transfer.
Let's review, to begin with, the essential characteristics
of water as a substance.
This is a diagram showing the phase equilibrium of water
as a function of temperature.
And that phase equilibrium is denoted here
by the equilibrium saturation vapor pressure.
So there are three phases represented
on this diagram, ice, liquid, and vapor.
All of these three phases co-exist at something
called the triple point.
All these phases are in equilibrium with each other.
This occurs at a temperature near zero degrees C and a vapor
pressure of a little bit over 6 hectopascals.
This curve is the phase equilibrium
between liquid water and vapor.
Notice that it increases toward the right
as one increases the temperature,
the vapor pressure increases.
And it does so according to something
called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which
is a very important relationship in atmospheric science.
So as one increases temperature, the saturation vapor pressure
increases.
It turns out it increases exponentially.
Now, beyond something called the critical point here,
it's no longer possible to distinguish
between the vapor and the liquid phase of water.
We don't need to worry about that in our atmosphere,
because that critical point occurs
at a temperature above 600 degrees Kelvin.
Now, this curve here represents the phase equilibrium
between liquid and ice.
It occurs at a temperature of zero degrees
at the triple point.
But that temperature actually declines as pressure goes up.
That means that as one applies pressure to water ice,
eventually one can melt it under pressure.
This is a somewhat peculiar characteristic
of water as a substance.
Other substances have phase equilibria
between their liquid and solid phases
which increase as one increases the temperature.
Now, the third equilibrium, according
to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
is the equilibrium between water ice, and vapor.
And this starts at the triple point
and goes down as the temperature decreases.
So like the vapor-liquid equilibria,
the saturation vapor pressure over ice
increases with temperature.
Now, one thing that you'll notice on this diagram
is the dashed line which is a continuation
of the liquid vapor equilibrium to temperatures
below the critical point.
This represents, once again, the equilibrium
between the vapor and liquid phases.
But we've carried that equilibrium below freezing.
We've done so, because it turns out--
and we'll talk about this later--
there can be a great deal of supercooled water
in the atmosphere, that is liquid water droplets that
exists at temperatures below freezing.
And the fact that these two curves are different,
that is the vapor ice equilibrium
differs from the vapor liquid equilibrium,
turns out to be important for the physics of clouds.
